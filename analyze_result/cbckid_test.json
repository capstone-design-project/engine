named rocco was training with his manager mickey the mutt okay rocco get the ball go get it get more fast was i that time ricky that was fast kid you're a good boy have a good boy treat wolf rocco was a good boxer he had fast paws and an even faster pounce but rocco didn't want to be just good he wanted to be the best well one day i'm gonna wear the heavy dog boxing champion collar around my neck mickey sure you will kid sure but mickey knew that to become the heavy dog boxing champ rocco would have to defeat the toughest meanest siberian husky around dragon lola [Music] mickey didn't think rocco was ready but rocco wouldn't let it go he begged mickey to set up a match between him and dragon nah come on mickey forget it kid you got the heart but you ain't got the tools dragon has all the machines high tech everything all we've got is a clicker and some treats mickey ever since i was a pup dogs always said you may be a boxer but you're no boxer you know and now i've got a chance to show them show myself if we're gonna do this rocks you're gonna have to train like you've never trained before i'll work you until even your tail hurts but when i'm done with you that husky won't know what hit him well i like the sound of that mickey you got a deal we're gonna need some more good boy treats so mickey set up the match and rocco began training like never before [Music] uh mr oh what's happening no yes right this is a podcast i forgot sorry this is what you call a training montage gary it shows rocco at the start of his training he's running through the streets jumping for frisbees sparring with other dogs okay i hear how the music starts to change here that means that his training is paying off he's running faster jumping higher and sparring with even bigger dogs he's getting strong now yeah won't be long now oh and here's the big finish he's running up some steps and celebrating like a champ you know with good boy treats yo wolf wow he's gonna win for sure you'd think so but meanwhile dragon has been doing his own training uh mr orlando oh uh yeah this is dragon's training montage he's getting better too but he's using all the latest technology he's got one of those tennis ball machines and he's catching balls like nobody's business and now he's running on a treadmill hooked up to machines suggesting dragon is more robot than husky oh i i see it yeah on the night of the big match the stadium was packed the crowd began to bark as rocco entered the stadium here comes brocco with his manager mickey the challenger hoping to take the world title and the world color from the champ oh that is going to be an uphill battle rocco is good but is he good enough to beat dragon i'm not so sure rocco climbed into the boxing ring and waited in his corner sounds like dragon is entering the arena yes that's the champion and he's being pulled by a sleigh of dogs an entrance fit for a husky the crowd cheered madly as dragon entered the ring he was even bigger than rocco had imagined rocco was truly an underdog yo doggy don't dwell they don't bite otherwise i have to [Laughter] [Music] rocco was scared why had he asked for this match [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] dodges dragon returns the favor with a one-two punch he's the bronco in a corner rocco get your paws up that's the round and it looks like it goes to dragon barracle is really gonna have to step it up if he wants a shot at that collar uh rocco what are you doing here you're getting wrecked out there oh i'm trying mickey but this guy ain't like nobody i ever fought ah baloney you get up there and show them who's top dog but round two was the same [Applause] and that's another round for dragon round after round went to dragon rocco was getting further and further behind boxers in your corners oh mickey what am i doing i can't beat this guy what's can't there ain't no cants rocks there's still one way to win this thing a ko i can't touch this dog i'm just not ready you gotta call the match he's gonna quit hey even after that whole training montage thingy it appeared so ah looks like rocco has had enough his manager is about to throw in the towel and dragon is gonna hold on to his collar wait what's this rocco i knew you could never beat me you may be a boxer but you'll never be a boxer [Music] the words that rocco had been hearing since he was just a young pup rang in his ears but instead of making him sad they made him feel something else nikki don't throw in the towel i'm going back out there rocco stood up triumphantly he didn't just think he could win he knew it i'm gonna win because i am a boxer and a boxer can you believe it rocco's continuing the match he looks like a whole new dog out there knock his block off rocks this round rocco was determined and focused rocco is coming at dragon hard dragon doesn't know what to do rocco boxed like never before here he was all take that and that and this dick this one and that wow and soon rocco jabs the dragon and again and there's another cut to this now oh that's gonna hurt for a moment everything was silent and in slow motion rocco's boxing glove connected once more with dragon
