    "script": "Brazil has recorded more than 4 000 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours by far its worst day since the start of the pandemic. The country has now recorded more than 330 000 deaths in total. The health system has been overwhelmed by surging cases, with thousands of infected patients unable to get a hospital bed. Paul adams reports, overcrowded hospitals, a health system on the brink of collapse and a population living in fear, kovid's spotlight, has ranged across the globe and now has brazil locked in its harsh glare. For the first time, the country has recorded more than four thousand covid related deaths in just 24 hours. Brazil's death toll now stands at around 337 000, second, only to the united states still behind both the u.s and britain in terms of death per capita, but a contagious new variant is fueling. The latest surge the death toll in march twice as high as the previous month. I think brazil now is not only the epicenter of the pandemic worldwide is a threat to the entire effort of the international community to control the pandemic in the planet. If brazil is not under control, the planet is not going to be under control. It's not going to be safe because we are brewing variants new variants. Every week, the country's defiant president jair bolsonaro continues to oppose a lockdown damaging the economy. He says would be worse than the virus itself, without citing evidence, he's linked quarantine measures with obesity and depression he's even tried to reverse restrictions imposed by local authorities. What we are facing here in brazil. What we have here is a sad situation that is the consequence of the lack of coordination in the federal level by the national government that we have here. It is president bolsonaro confronting governors and mayors. The government is under pressure. It knows the world is watching with a critical eye. The country's new foreign minister says: there's a balance to be struck from this is urgent and president bolsonaro has instructed me to face this mission. I emphasize the urgency of health, the urgency of the economy and the urgency of sustainable development. Scenes like this are undermining confidence in the government. The president says: 2021 will be the year of vaccinations, but fewer than 10 percent of brazilians have had their first jab, some say much more. Drastic action is needed. Paul adams, bbc news well earlier, I spoke to dr danilo maksuji, a cardiologist working in the intensive care unit at one sao paulo hospital yesterday was a very catastrophic day more than four thousand. That is a really scare. We also continued to see increasingly of younger population in icu, of course started scientific data, and what worries is the quick deterioration of clinical steps of the patient? Probably this new sepa is more aggressive. Yes, let's talk about this new variant because I was reading this morning. There are up to about 92 variants that exist uh in in brazil, but uh, it's the is it the manuals uh variant that is of most concern right now? Yes, because this is more transmissible and the people are more in the streets for now, and this became the situation very dangerous for everybody at your hospital. Are there enough beds? Do staff? Have enough ppe just tell us what it's like there? Oh, we need to open new icu beds every day, uh we ever every day. We need to make some training for these new professionals that are going to work in the icu and this kind of situation. Uh is very uh. How can I say for you, it's very uh, difficult to to maintain the balance of the situation and what about the vaccine program in brazil, because we saw there in our piece only 10 percent of the population so far have been given the vaccine yeah. There are two that are producer here, but not on large scale uh, despite of the farts of bhutan and fear, cruising institute, uh vaccines purchased externally will not be available immediately, causing the delay of fascination. I'm sure that if you had more of a scenes, uh the situation would be would be better. Brazil has a very good company, fascination program, and the acceptance of the scenes in general here is very high. The president bolsonaro has now appointed his fourth health minister. Are you confident that he will be able to implement the right changes uh to turn this around? Ah, we hope so, but the the problem is that every day we watch uh someone of the present teen and your sons giving contract to contract, dictatory uh information to the population. This is a political scenario of polarization, keeps uh people away from the the reality uh. It's common to see. People think that the number of debts is not so high uh or seeking ineffective treatment support by these statements. We hope that the new minister can change it.",
