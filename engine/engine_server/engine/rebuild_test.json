    "script": "Mr orlando, mr orlando, hey, is it story time now uh? Well, yes, gary, but first we need to welcome everyone to the story, store the podcast, where your stories are made done so now. Is it story time? Well, no, no gary, we haven't even checked the answering machine on it. Oh okay I'll write this story. As the dog who box, I love it. I love it. I love it. Can we start the story now? Please: okay, okay, gary, but what's the big hurry? Well, I just love stories, mr orlando. Well, that's a good reason and you're in luck because I have just the one. I take you to philadelphia dog park where a young dog, a boxer named rocco, was training with his manager. Mickey the mutt, okay rocco, get the ball go, get it get more fast. Was I that time ricky that was fast kid you're, a good boy, have a good boy treat wolf. Rocco was a good boxer. He had fast paws and an even faster pounce, but rocco didn't want to be just good. He wanted to be the best. Well, one day, I'm gonna wear the heavy dog boxing champion collar around my neck. Mickey sure you will kid sure, but mickey knew that to become the heavy dog boxing champ rocco would have to defeat the toughest meanest siberian husky around dragon. Lola [Music], mickey didn't think rocco was ready, but rocco, wouldn't let it go. He begged mickey to set up a match between him and dragon. Nah come on mickey forget it kid. You got the heart, but you ain't got the tools. Dragon has all the machines, high tech. Everything all we've got is a clicker and some treats mickey. Ever since I was a pup dogs always said you may be a boxer, but you're no boxer, you know, and now I've got a chance to show them. Show myself. If we're gonna, do this rocks you're gonna have to train like you've, never trained before I'll work you until even your tail hurts, but when I'm done with you that husky won't know what hit him. Well, I, like the sound of that mickey you got a deal. We're gonna need some more good boy treats so mickey set up the match and rocco began training like never before [Music] uh. Mr oh, what's happening! No! Yes right! This is a podcast. I forgot sorry. This is what you call a training montage gary. It shows rocco at the start of his training, he's running through the streets jumping for frisbees sparring with other dogs. Okay, I hear how the music starts to change here. That means that his training is paying off, he's running faster, jumping, higher and sparring, with even bigger dogs he's getting strong. Now, yeah won't be long. Now, oh and here's the big finish, he's running up some steps and celebrating like a champ, you know with good boy, treats yo wolf, wow, he's gonna win for sure you'd think so, but meanwhile dragon has been doing his own training uh. Mr orlando, oh uh yeah! This is dragon's training, montage he's getting better too, but he's using all the latest technology. He's got one of those tennis ball machines and he's catching balls like nobody's business and now he's running on a treadmill hooked up to machines. Suggesting dragon is more robot than husky. Oh, I I see it yeah. On the night of the big match, the stadium was packed, the crowd began to bark as rocco entered. The stadium here comes brocco with his manager, mickey the challenger hoping to take the world title and the world color from the champ. Oh, that is going to be an uphill battle. Rocco is good, but is he good enough to beat dragon? I'm not so sure rocco climbed into the boxing ring and waited in his corner sounds like dragon is entering the arena. Yes, that's the champion and he's being pulled by a sleigh of dogs, an entrance fit for a husky, the crowd, cheered madly, as dragon entered the ring he was even bigger than rocco had imagined. Rocco was truly an underdog yo doggy, don't dwell, they don't bite. Otherwise I have to [Laughter]. [Music] rocco was scared. Why had he asked for this match? [Applause] [Music] [Applause], [Music], [Applause], dodges dragon returns, the favor with a one-two punch, he's the bronco in a corner rocco, get your paws up. That's the round and it looks like it goes to dragon. Barracle is really gonna have to step it up if he wants a shot at that collar, uh rocco. What are you doing here, you're getting wrecked out there? Oh I'm trying mickey, but this guy ain't like nobody. I ever fought. Ah baloney you get up there and show them who's top dog, but round two was the same [Applause] and that's another round for dragon round after round went to dragon rocco was getting further and further behind boxers in your corners, oh mickey. What am I doing? I can't beat this guy. What's can't there ain't, no cants rocks. There's still one way to win this thing, a ko. I can't touch this dog, I'm just not ready. You gotta call the match. He's gonna quit hey! Even after that whole training, montage thingy, it appeared so ah looks like rocco, has had enough. His manager is about to throw in the towel and dragon is gonna hold on to his collar. Wait. What's this rocco, I knew you could never beat me. You may be a boxer, but you'll never be a boxer [Music] the words that rocco had been hearing, since he was just a young pup rang in his ears, but instead of making him sad, they made him feel something else: nikki don't throw in the towel. I'm going back out. There rocco stood up triumphantly. He didn't just think he could win. He knew it. I'm gonna win because I am a boxer and a boxer. Can you believe it rocco's continuing the match? He looks like a whole new dog out. There knock his block off rocks this round. Rocco was determined and focused rocco is coming at dragon. Hard dragon doesn't know what to do rocco boxed like never before here. He was all take that and that and this dick this one and that wow and soon rocco jabs the dragon and again and there's another cut to this. Now. Oh, that's, gonna hurt. For a moment. Everything was silent and in slow motion, rocco's boxing glove connected once more with dragon dragon teetered on his paws and then dragon is down one two: three, that's a chaos. It's a knockout rocco wins the ref held rocco's paw in the air and declared him the heavy boxing dog champion. You did it rox you did it no mickey. We did it. We did it. Morocco held up his brand new champion caller. This is for you adrian adrian hold the jingle jangle uh who's. Adrian yeah, that's another story, but the point is with a lot of hard work. If you believe in yourself, you can reach any goal. Just like rocco the end whoa. That story had a lot of punch. It certainly did ah what a great suggestion listeners, if you have a story suggestion.
