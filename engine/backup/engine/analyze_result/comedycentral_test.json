    "script": "Hi, I'm comedian and former amateur watercolor player, mary beth brown welcome to sex ed. This is a show where I use my text, emails and instagram polls to answer important questions. For example: bad dates: are they an occupational hazard or is it just you [Music] back in march of 2018, my naive little brain had an idea. Let's give dating apps another try, so I set up a profile and matched with a hawkeye and we went on a date. It was a nice little spot on the lower east side where they play old porn on the tvs. The date was pretty good, so we decided we'd. Do it again. He came to my apartment on a friday night and immediately insulted the shorts I was wearing. He then said that his friends looked up my comedy and said it was all right. This is what's called negging. I have three brothers. So if I want to get made fun of there's plenty of people in my life to do that, we went to bed, he continued to annoy me and when we woke up the next day, I decided to pretend I didn't feel well and cancel our breakfast plans. This is a message to everyone watching this nagging doesn't work, it's also not a personality. Despite what you may have read in books or seen on tv. It's also a good reminder that bad dates happen to good people, but as tyra banks once said, I'm not a victim. I grow from it and I learn [Music]. I conducted a survey on my instagram to get an answer to one simple question: what is the national mood on dating true or false? I think the current dating climate is conducive to meeting a good romantic partner. An overwhelming number of respondents said that this statement was false and anyone who's currently single will not be surprised by these results. We're living in a romantic dystopia, a wasteland where quality resources are scarce and only the strong survive. Just remember that every bad experience makes you stronger, more resilient and more prepared to face whatever obstacle comes at you next. Eventually, all of these bad experiences will lead you to a good one. So just don't give up, or do it's totally understandable if you do next up true or false, dating is fun. It's a toss-up folks with a slight lead on false. I personally am filled with hope by all those people who said true if you're in that demo. What's your secret, let us know hell, write a book. A long book tell us everything my homework assignment to you, you being any single people watching this just keep expectations low. You can't fail. This is one of my favorite topics, because just when I think I've heard it all you, girls come to me with new ways. People have found to make dates bad today, I'm so lucky to be joined by kate and drew. Who will be talking to us about some of their recent experiences? Hey? Why don't you tell us about your first date after lockdown? This is with this guy and we go to this bar and we start. We get on the topic of wuthering heights, which I've never read, but I'm a pretentious who likes to pretend that I've read it. I've also never read it. He starts talking about how kathy and heathcliff are this great couple, and the only thing I know about the book is that they're, terrible people and terrible together- and I was like just because two people are terrible to each other- doesn't mean they're a good couple and he was like. I disagree. Take my mom and my stepdad, for example. I was like oh, this is therapy. I didn't know that I was being paid for this session, but I love it okay, so he starts telling me about how his stepdad is running this con artist business, where he sells sex dolls, because now they all pretend to be in these polyamorous relationships with these sex dolls to boost sales. Wait, how is it a scam? Are they not delivering the dolls? So they have this in these relationships in the sex doll business. Apparently, that's like a big thing where, like people are in real relationships to like destigmatize it which I'm like you know what it's your oath somehow, but we hate stigma, power to them, they're, making a living. So all this happens and I'm like you know what this is a terrible date whatever we like go for a walk afterwards and I like mention that I'm an actor- and I like did this like voiceover workshop a few weeks prior that I mentioned and he was like. Oh I love cartoons. I was like great, that's amazing, for you he went a to c and then he says, do you want to hear my anime impressions? No and he starts doing them so many of them. I think there was ten. Were they supposed to be funny or he wanted to show you the accuracy, the accuracy did you get just to hearing the impressions? That's what's also important. I think he was like. Do you want to hear my anime impressions and I genuinely don't think I answered asking- was just a gesture. He didn't really care therapy with men is so normal, but also like men. Just assuming that I'm interested in their interests without, like any confirmation like I don't know, another species that would like jump into anime impressions, if I say I've, never seen it yeah, and then we made it at the end of the night because, like you made out yeah first date, post quarantine, what else was I supposed to do a purpose? Of course you had to legally. I think, if you hadn't done it, you would have been thrown in jail. It wasn't even a good makeup. I don't think it was worth it. I've spoken since I toyed with the idea of a second date um, but I was rightfully talked out of that. We've all been in a situation where we've had a really not great first date and said: well, surely the second one has to be better, but no you've come to find that it's actually many times worse, I mean I wish him well. I wish him well too. We wish his parents are well and, above all, we wish that the sex dolls well now ju you're, coming to us with the story of a sixth date. So I I was seeing this guy for about two weeks and then it got to the point where he invited me over to his new apartment on the upper east side. So I arrived at his apartment with some some cookies we started making out. I start to kiss him on his stomach and he was like. Please don't do that. I don't like that, and I was like. Oh okay, I was like well what do you like, and he just looks at me and he's like um, I, like doggy style and a clean, buckle. Yeah, that's right! It was his response to me. So he said that to me I was like okay and then we began to have sex and as soon as we started to have sex, he truly left his body. I've never seen anything like that. He was off in another place disassociating just not with me in that room. I could have been like a hole in the wall that he was after. We finished uh. We were laying next to each other and he was fully grossed out by how much he enjoyed it. I'll say and left up from his butt from the bed and immediately jumped in the shower. We found his way back to his bedroom you're watching a movie, and I was standing up. He just looks at me and goes you know. I would love it if you got your ass, really big, like just did some squat and just like made your ass like really really juicy, I was totally taken aback. I couldn't believe that he was giving me notes on my body after we had, you know, had sex in which my ass was in the air. So I looked at him and I was like wow. That's that's insane that you would say that he was like what was that rude? I was like yeah, I mean we just had sex and you're, giving me a note on my body and he lightly apologized and then um fast forward a little bit into the night. I grabbed the cookies that I had brought um department and we were eating them in his bed and, as I was eating one of the cookies he looked at me and he said you know. I hope these cookies go straight to your ass okay, so I couldn't believe he said that to me after I expressed to him that it's kind of urban feeling um, but I will say it was 11 30 on the upper east side, so I did stay the night well, the joke's on him, because the cookies did go straight to your ass and now your ass is fat and juicy so never heard from him. Yet this was three weeks ago. So much was said by saying nothing. I think we both knew the vibe was just off. I feel like when you ask them what they like in bed and they their response is a clean and doggy they're, absolutely a serial killer, because that sounds medical they're about to do an exam. I think you had sex with a guy who dexter is based on. You know what I think you're right well, thank you for sharing your stories. We do hope that the viewers at home have all learned something from this. I think my main takeaway, whenever I talk and think and hear about bad dates, is that if you go on a bad date, you are not required to kiss them. If you would repeat after me, yes, if I go on a bad date, if I go on a bad date, I am not required to kiss them. I am not I'm not required to keep them and now for the folks at home. If I go on a bad date, I am not required to kiss them. Don't forget that kate and drew thank you so much for your bravery, your resilience and your willingness to share. Although you both made different choices about how to proceed in the wake of your bad dates, I wish you both nothing but the best, and I hope that you find what you're looking for cheers. Girls cheers as I reflect on these insightful narratives. I couldn't stop thinking about sparkling clean, buttholes and questionably accurate anime impressions when did dating start to feel less like two people. Looking for love and more like one person being traumatized on a hidden camera, show hosted by ashton kutcher. Despite everything we know, 58 of people are optimistic. They will meet the right person in the next one to three years. You know what that sounds like to me hope and even rooted in delusion. It's still hope you.",
