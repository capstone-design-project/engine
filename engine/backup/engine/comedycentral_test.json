Today we're going to talk about 10 ways to stop translating in your head. Let's get started, identify objects around you in English. The first way to stop translating in your head is to identify the objects around you in your target language. So if you're studying English, that means you look at the objects around the room. Look at the things in your life, don't think of them in your native language, first think of them in your target language. First. So if I look around the room, I see a computer I shouldn't think my native language word. I should think my target language word so start with the items and the situations in your everyday life. If I say computer in English, maybe I should say computer in Japanese, I should say not I, don't know water in English, I should say Oh Mesa in Japanese, so start associating the words in your target language with your everyday life. Now so, if you're studying English, that means start getting familiar with the things in your everyday life in English, repeat phrases you hear native speakers use tip number two is to repeat the phrases that you hear native speakers use. So if you're watching this channel, for example, or you're, watching a TV show or a movie, listen for the way that native speakers make those phrases. If you hear a phrase, you have never heard before, or you hear an interesting combination of words. Try to repeat them yourself, don't just listen! Try to save them yourself, if you're in a public space and it's difficult for you to do that. Fine practice in a place where you feel more comfortable. Maybe if you have some private space to practice, just repeat them! Get your mouth used to saying the words. The way that the speaker's the native speakers do. So, if you never actually say words if you're, only taking in if you're, only singing and you're not actually producing the language, it's it's kind of hard to to practice and to to really hone your pronunciation to improve your pronunciation. So when you listen to native speakers, try to repeat after them, so, for example, if you're studying English, you can try to repeat after this video you can repeat after the things I'm saying, because maybe I'm using an expression or I'm using a certain series of vocabulary, words together, the way a native speaker would- and it's maybe a good idea to try to practice the ways that native speakers put their words together. So try to repeat after native speakers, especially when you're looking at media- and you can do this when you're reading books too, you can try to read out, read out loud, interesting lines of books that you find or something that maybe is difficult for. You very nice practice to make a situation where you can't escape into your native language. Make a situation where you can't escape into your native language essentially means immerse yourself, of course, going to that country are going to a place where you can speak only that language is very difficult for some of you totally understand. But if in your life, you can create a situation in your library in your room in your house somewhere for just an hour or I, don't know maybe a day, I, don't know what your schedule is like, but if you can create a situation or create an environment where you have no choice but to use that language and you cannot escape meaning, you cannot go back to using your native language as a crutch. You can't use the native language at all. It forces you to use the language that you're studying. So, of course, if you are lucky enough to live in the country or to live in a place where people speak, the language you're studying great, but you have to go out and interact with people. You have to put yourself in a place where you have no choice but to speak. It's very hard and it's very scary- and it's very embarrassing at first, but if you take time to find places and to make environments that are comfortable for you, where you feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions, it's very valuable for your learning process. This is actually something that I did totally I totally did this. My Japanese wasn't very good for a long time, but then I started making friends who could not speak English. Actually, I just did this through finding hobbies. There was a hobby that I had I joined. A group I joined actually a school to where I could learn how to do that. Hobby and everything was taught only in Japanese, and the people in my class only spoke Japanese mostly, and then maybe we would go out for drinks and food late at night or on the weekends, and everybody spoke only Japanese and if I couldn't communicate even simply in Japanese, I had no hope of keeping that friendship together. So it forced me to study it forced me to think about the words they were using and to try to learn those words, those patterns as well as how to produce them. Naturally, myself so I was learning the vocabulary words. The people around me were using and learning how to apply them on my own. That was only possible because I had no escape in those situations. So try to do that, even if you can do it yourself in your house, it's super helpful, I, think watch, TV and movies in your target language without subtitles tip number four is to watch TV and movies in your target language, without subtitles, without subtitles, so I think that watching with subtitles can be very beneficial. So if I'm watching something or if you want to watch something with subtitles on great, let's I sometimes find that I can, in my case, I think too much about reading the subtitles and I forget to listen. So maybe, if you've seen a movie in your target language a few times with the subtitles on try, turning the subtitles off and think about the like character's body, language, the words they're using you can always look that up later. Look up the you know the words you don't know in a dictionary but try to do it where you're, focusing completely on the way that people are using their words, try not to use the subtitles so kind of play around with it a little bit. If there's a word, that's difficult for you to hear, you can actually turn on the subtitles in like the in the native language of the movie as well. That's something that I've done like. If look if I wanted to study Japanese, it's very useful when the actual words spoken in Japanese appear on the screen. Sometimes it's easier for me to catch a word. If I see it visually and I hear it at the same time, so another way to kind of explore how you can use TV and movies is to actually turn on the closed captions, like the the words on the screen in the native language of the movie. So so this is sort of two points in one. So one watch movies without subtitles, meaning subtitles in your native language and hint to is to watch movies with closed captioning on, but the closed captioning is in your target language, not in your native language. So you can try those two things with TV and with movies. Don't bring a dictionary to your lesson. Tip number five is don't bring a dictionary to your lesson? Okay, so it gives me a second here so I understand the dictionaries. It was especially electronic dictionaries. We have them on. Our phones now are very, very convenient. Of course, it's important to use them and it's a they're, a great resource to have, however, one thing that really bothers me and that I think is detrimental. It's not helpful for students is when students are in a lesson and they're practicing conversation, and they reach a point in the conversation where they don't know the word they want to use. They know it in their native language and they don't know how to say it in their target language. They pull out their dictionary. They say to this the person listening to them their practice partner in their lesson where they have a limited period of time just a moment, and then they look it up on their phone. It takes a few seconds. The flow of the conversation stops and then they say a word. It's like wow. No, that's not you don't have that ability. You don't have the ability to do that in a conversation with a native speaker, most people like if you go to a bank and try to open a bank account, are you really going to pull out your dictionary and sit there and try to communicate? You know just a moment just a moment as you look up each word, you don't know no or if you do that's not a real conversation, so instead try using a different strategy by that I mean if you find a word. You don't know in conversation, explain the word to your conversation partner. Maybe they know the word if you're speaking with a native speaker, this is a chance for them to teach you a word I find that when people take the time to teach me a word, I remember the word much better than just looking it up on my dictionary so try to resist. Maybe you can bring a dictionary to your lesson, but don't use it or try not to use it in your conversation practice. It's just. It destroys the flow of a conversation so instead practice the skill of describing the vocabulary word. You want to use and learn how to ask the meaning of a word or learn how to ask for a vocabulary word from your partner, so you can use an expression like. Ah what's the word, that means pop habla or you know it's this thing that does this and this and this. So this is an opportunity for you to describe characteristics of something or find a different way. You can use your body language, you can use whatever you have a lot of tools, but try not to use a dictionary in a conversation, because it's not realistic, train responses to common questions. Number six is a quick one. I think number six hint number six I have is just to Train responses to common questions, train responses to common questions. So, for example, a very common question in English is hey. How are you you should know how to answer this question? Just have a default response: hey. How are you I'm good? If it takes you a long time to answer the question? Hey, how are you you need to practice? I think that's a pretty good, a pretty good indicator. So, for example, sometimes I ask students a question like that they haven't quite gotten the idea of how to respond just yet they're. Not so quick at responding, I, say hey, how are you and they say yes and then they think and they go. I am I'm good and it's like that's a very common question, so think about just a default response that you can spit out that you can quickly say if it's, how was your weekend or hey what's up, or what do you want to do for dinner tonight? Think about like just a handful, meaning just a few responses to those questions and train them quickly. Just how are you I'm good? How are you I'm? Okay? How are you not bad, there's three, so it's just training responses to those questions. There's no reason to be surprised by a question like how are you, like that's a very common question so for those common questions, train responses to that we've got a bunch of videos, especially beginner level, videos for some example responses. You can do so don't get stuck with the little questions, just train a few responses practice. A few responses till they feel natural to you, it'll save you time and it'll help the person asking the question to to move forward in the conversation, okay study with materials that don't provide a translation. The next tip is to study with materials that don't provide a translation so by this I mean if you're, using worksheets or some kind of textbook or whatever, and it has your target language, the language you're studying, and it has your native language next to it. While this can be useful, I feel that if you can studying your materials only in your target language and then simplified explanations for more detailed points. Also in your target language can be a little bit better. So I should I, don't want to say, like you, should only study things in your target language and nothing from your native language because of course like it can be helpful, sometimes to look up a word or to understand a grammar point in your native language, but where possible, if you can find something that provides simplified explanations in your target language, it can be really really helpful because again, you're thinking, you're learning to think on, like a simpler on a more basic level about the language you're, studying in the language that you're studying. So this can be really really good, so finding some materials to use. Where there's no translation, maybe you can practice, of course, with with books and with written materials, but also with like video materials as well. So there are a variety of different ways that you can find materials in your target language like in video and TV. So some things to think about. There are the level of vocabulary words. People are using in the media content you're, watching who the media content is intended for children, young adults, adults, the speed at which the speaker is talking. So, like I have the ability to change the level of difficulty of videos based on the rate of speech, the vocabulary words that I use and how many like idioms and things I use so I could make a video very difficult. We could make a very like a very difficult video series by levelling up our vocabulary, use or by speaking very quickly or, as you might see in, like our English in three minutes series. We can also use very simple vocabulary and speak at a low rate of speech. So maybe right now. This is a very intermediate level. Video, so please think about that, so not just for written materials, but also for your audio and visual materials. Think about who your audience is the level of the material and so on. It can be really fun and it can be helpful to think about your your target language in your target language, all right, we're all Muslim study phrases in addition to single vocabulary. The next tip is study phrases in addition to single vocabulary, words. So yes, of course, vocabulary is important, but I find it personally very, very useful to look at how a vocabulary word is used in a phrase because sometimes using it in a phrase, helps you understand the nuance of that vocabulary. Word really really well. So, if I like a word like crazy, for example, in English, depending on the situation where the word crazy is used, it could mean something different. It could mean like a person who is mentally confused or mixed up. It could also mean something really good. It could mean something really bad. So if we look only at the word crazy, it's quite difficult to understand, really the meaning of the word. But if you look at the way the word is used in a phrase. You can get a lot more information, so take a look at the way people use words in phrases, not just a single vocabulary. Words. You can learn a lot more. That way, I think do your daily activities in English, where possible. The next step is to do your daily activities in your target language. So if you're studying English, that means try to do some daily activities in English if possible. So this can be very, very boring stuff, but just think about it when you're doing the activity so like right now, I'm filming a video for English class, 101.com or I'm going to work, I'm cooking breakfast I'm doing the laundry. What do I have to do tomorrow so try thinking about your everyday life in English. If you're, studying English try thinking about your everyday activities, the people that you meet, what are you doing so this is a way to help. You practice your verbs. So if you don't know if you're I don't know you're doing something at work and you're like oh, my gosh, how do I explain the what's the verb? For you know, a picture like I want to blah blah blah a picture. What's the word, you can check a dictionary at that point and go uh. Its draw like I need to use the verb, draw or draw a picture, so you can find these little gaps in your everyday life, these little gaps in your knowledge, if you think about your everyday activities in your target language, if you don't think about it in your target language, you might not realize you have vocabulary, gaps or phrase gaps here and there. So this is a really good and kind of funny actually way to study use a learner's dictionary for new words. The last tip is to use a learner's dictionary for new words, so in English there are learners dictionaries available in English, so my favorite, my personal favorite, is merriam-webster. Merriam-Webster is a fantastic dictionary resource they're, so interesting, and they have tons of like historical information. I really do just sit and like readings on the dictionary page. Lately, it's true but of course, there's a definition, there's a meaning for words. There are example, sentences for words, but merriam-webster also has what's called a learner's dictionary. If you find a word that you don't recognize, you can check it in a dictionary in a learner's dictionary, and it gives you a simplified, a simple explanation in simple English of that word. So, instead of checking it in your native language, you can check it in your target language. So again, this helps you to understand the word that you are that you're focused on, but you understand it from the language you're, studying not from your native language, so using a learner's dictionary can be really really useful as well all right. So those are ten tips. Those are 10 tips to help you stop translating in your head. I know it's very difficult, but it's it takes time and it takes practice and I hope that these are a few strategies that can help you as you study any language. Of course. This is an English language channel in English language learning channel, but I think these tips are pretty good for learning just about any language really so I hope those are useful for you.

Thanks very much for watching this episode of top words and I will see you again soon: hi hi, everyone, I'm Bridget, and welcome to today's lesson.

Good morning is the first thing you say to someone when you see them in the morning good morning, sir, would you like a cup of coffee good morning, could I please get some orange juice good morning, I'm still tired from the night before hello, hello is the most common greeting you'll hear that and hi hello is a polite nice way to greet someone when you see them hello, everyone says it. You cannot go wrong. Saying hello! Hello can be used at any time of the day, no matter whether it's morning or at night or at 4:00 a.m. when you see someone, you can say hello and it will still be appropriate long time. No see long time, no see it's not necessarily grammatically correct, but it's a saying that we have hey long time, no see what it means is that you haven't seen that person in a long time. So it literally means long time. No see long. Time no see is something you say to someone when you haven't seen them in a while: hey John long time, no see how are the wife and kids, how have you been hey? How have you been I haven't seen you in a long time. How have you been is asking someone how they're doing and how they've been for the past? However long if you haven't seen them in a while, you might say hey long time, no see how have you been? How have you been that's past tense? It implies that you haven't seen them in a while, and you want to hear about how they are and how they've been for all of that time that you haven't seen them hey long time, no see how have you been, how are you, how are you means? How are you doing? How are you feeling? How is everything it's a standard thing that you might say to anyone, even if you've seen them the day before you might see them today, I'd say hey, how are you, how is it going? Hey, how's it going how's it going is a more informal way to say how are you, so, how are you and how's it going? They mean the same thing. It's asking how you're doing how you are feeling is everything. Okay with you what's up, what's up is another way of saying hey? How is it going, but this one is even more informal, so you might say this to friends: hey what's up and they'll say nothing just living my life. You know day in and day out, hey, what's up hey what's up good afternoon good afternoon. How are you would you, like some lunch good afternoon, is a polite way to greet someone in the afternoon. So if you run into your boss, you might say good afternoon: it's very nice. It's polite, not a lot of people say it to their friends, but it's it's a polite way to greet someone good evening good evening is a nice way to greet someone in the evening time. You can only use this phrase in the evening because it's wishing someone a good evening, it's saying hello at a certain time of day good evening. Would you like some dinner good evening? Have you eaten yet all of my examples involve food. It seems it's nice to meet you it's nice to meet you. This is something that's very common to say the first time that you meet someone you might shake their hand and say hi, it's nice to meet you. My name is Bridget. My name.

Wanna speak real English from your first les sign up for your free lifetime, account at English class 101.com, hi everyone, I'm christine from english class 101 comm in this video, we'll be talking about how to curse like an english native speaker, piss a slang term for urine, for example, don't piss your pants, you can say this when you're really scared or anxious. For example, if you're about to go onstage to make a speech or perform, someone can say, don't piss your pants, you can do it pissed off to be really angry when I'm angry I can say, hey, I'm, really pissed off at you right now. Why did you do that for loser used to describe an uncool person in high school? My friends and I would use this a lot and we would say: hey loser how's it going idiot used to install people by saying they're, not intelligent of all the mean things that you can say. This is on the lighter side, but people still use it shoot. This is used to show disappointment or frustration without using a stronger curse. Word shoot I spilled my coffee shut up. You can use this when you want them to be quiet or there's something surprising that you just heard you can say, shut up, no way ticked off. To be really angry. You can say this with pissed off, so this is actually an older term. Not many people use this as much anymore, because most people actually just use pissed-off fool. This is similar to saying someone is like a clown. You can say you're, acting like a fool right now jerk. This is a light insult used to describe someone who is mean, for example, if there's someone bullying another person, that person is being a jerk whip. This means someone who isn't strong. There is a movie out right now called Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Have you seen it? Have you not I haven't yet. So how was it? If you have any more questions? Please leave a comment below see you next time: hey everyone, I'm Parris from English class 101.com in this video, we're talking about how to ask and give directions. Let's start to love. The first phrase is: where is the? Where is the, for example, you can ask: where is the bank this can be used to ask for a general location or detailed directions? Don't be surprised if you only receive basic information, for example, next to the grocery store? The next phrase is I need to go to the I need to go to the, for example, you can say I need to go to the police station. The word need is used, but this is used for non-emergencies as well. How do I get to the? How do I get to the? For example, you can say how do I get to the museum? This question can be used to ask for step-by-step directions instead of a general location. Is that near here is the near here, for example, you can say: is the library near here if you're unfamiliar with an area, you can ask to get this information about a specific place where you want to go? Is the bathroom near here? Excuse me: do you know where the is excuse me? Do you know where the is, for example, you can say excuse me, do you know where the park is only youth? Excuse me when you're starting a conversation with a stranger, another common phrase is, is the far from here is the far from here, for example, you can say is the post office far from here. This is an indirect way to ask for directions. People will tell you how far the place is and probably tell you the best way to get there walking taking a bus driving uber. Now, let's take a look at expressions to give directions. Turn left turn left. For example, you can say turn left after two blocks. This gives you information about how far you should go before you make any changes. In this case, you should go left to the left left turn right turn right, for example, you can say turn right at the third traffic light. This also gives you information about how far you should go before taking another action. In this case, you should go right, go straight, go straight. This simply tells you to go in one direction. It also implies that if you keep going straight that you will eventually find what you're looking for go past go past. For example, you can say go past the church. A landmark is just an easily noticeable place, for example, a movie theater restaurant at the corner of at the corner of, for example, you can say it's at the corner of this means that a place is located at the corner or two streets meet in front of in front of, for example, you can say the bus station is in front of the supermarket. We use front to refer to the main entrance of a building. It can also mean visible from the front and doesn't necessarily mean it's directly in front of something behind behind. For example, you can say the parking lot is behind the movie theater. We use behind to say that something is at the rear of a building. The front of a building is its main entrance so which side it's facing. The street is really not important. Next - next -, for example, you can say the restaurant is next to the part. This is an example of using a nonspecific location to give general directions next to can be anywhere beside in front of or around a place. Mcdonald's is next to my house between between, for example, you can say the store is between the coffee shop and the pet store, but queen is used with two other places when using between the main place will always be in the middle of the two other places. Okay, that's all for this lesson, which phrase do you like the most leave us a comment, and let us know, but I'll, see you next time, guys bye, hey guys, I'm Parris from English class 101.com in this video we'll be talking about making complaints of English. So, let's get started. The first complaint is I'm starving, I'm starving. This is an exaggeration you can use when you're hungry I am always starving even right. Now the next complaint is its noisy. Its noisy. This kind of complaint is one that you would make to a friend telling the staff of a restaurant won't help, since they can't tell people to be quiet, I hate when it's noisy restaurants save that for another time, then we have it's hot, it's hot. This can be used to talk about the weather or the temperature of a room. You can add a request like can you turn on the air-conditioner? I am never hot, so I like that. The next complaint is it's cold, it's cold. This can be used to talk about the weather or the temperature of a room. You can add a request like can you turn on the heater? I always make this request, because it's always too cold everywhere everywhere. It's too expensive, it's too expensive, even if you have enough money to buy something, it may be more money than you want to spend. It would probably be considered rude to say this to someone who works at a store, but I always think okay I'm in Gucci. It's way too expensive. Another common complaint is I'm. Tired, I'm, tired use this complaint to imply that you want to sit down. Relax, go home, take a break when I babysit, my five-year-old cousin I, leave thinking I'm tired. The next complaint is I gained weight, I gained weight. This is a self-criticism that implies that you want to lose weight. Men, people say I got so fat I'm always broke. I'm always broke use this to complain about never having enough money. I am always broke because I always want more money. The next complaint is my job is boring. My job is boring. This is a really common complaint used by people who don't think their jobs are very exciting. Usually it means that you want to find a different, more fun job. It's alright teachers, your job isn't boring. That person stinks that person stinks. You can use stings to talk about a literal, physical smell or a general insult, meaning that you don't like how someone smells I hate when people smell on the bus, not good, not okay. The next complaint is there's too much traffic there's too much traffic. This is a common complaint among people who commute to work by car. Certain roads are especially bad during rush hour, which is the time in the morning or night. Most people are going home or to work. If I left out, it was 7 p.m. I would be here in 10 minutes, but because it's daytime in LA it took me 30 minutes to get here and I Drive really really fast, and it still took me 30 minutes. The next complaint is the Wi-Fi here is too slow. The Wi-Fi here is too slow. This is just a general complaint. You may have about the internet speed if you're at a cafe or somewhere with Wi-Fi. You can request that they reset the Wi-Fi to improve the speed if you're having a party and you're having friends over and your Wi-Fi is too slow. You might as well end that party now no Wi-Fi no party, my boss is annoying. My boss is annoying. Annoying can be used to mean that someone does things that you don't like, or they ask you to do things that you don't like either way. An annoying boss is a bad experience.

My name is Alisha and today I am joined again in the studio by my goal, hello, and today we're going to be talking about things that were cool in the 90s, the things that were interesting or things that maybe we were interested in in the 90s I'm, guessing that we're going to have some very different opinions based on our experiences at the 90s. So let's get right into it. Michael your first item, please: okay, boy bands, so I, remember boy. Bands were very, very popular when I was a kid in the 90s I had three older brothers who had punched me and tell me boy: bands are for girls, don't like boy bands, so that was my experience with them and they became kind of uncool I feel like after the 90s, and then they never were uncool in like Korea and like a lot of Asian countries, they still had like a strong boy, band kind of scene or whatever good bands. Now. Is that really what they're called yeah I don't know? I just mean I, think I feel like boy they're boy bands that are now becoming boys to men. Maybe that's me so I mean now they keep now it came back like what is that? What's the British one, now it's kind of cool again. Well one direction, one direction, yeah so I think it's come back full circle. Didn't they just break up I'm gonna go with something that I loved in the 90s. This is probably way too specific, uh probably but it's this show called Doug that was on Nickelodeon and there weren't a whole lot of episodes of Duggars I, don't know like 20 or 30 I feel like not even that many did you ever see. This show yeah, that's very nostalgic for me: I, don't 20:30 episode, I feel I feel like I had I'd seen them. Also I know that I saw them all because I they it would come back. It would come on one day after school and I'd be like I've seen this episode, but the whole the whole idea with Doug is Doug was like this. Just this plain kid and he had an older sister. He went to school, he had a dog and a best friend and he would just encounter these every day of life scenarios that would be kind of troubling or he wouldn't know how to deal with them, but like he was kind of a role model I feel like he was kind of being like a good kid or sometimes he would get into trouble. But then you know eventually he would solve the problem or he'd find a way out of it. So but I really loved that show I really loved Nickelodeon in general during the 90s it yeah did you watch that channel? Of course, I love to Nickelodeon, um I. Think I was more like Fox stuff, like that, but I guess I'll segue into another one of mine you're talking about wholesome so something that's. My childhood I was raised on TV the sitcoms, so I think this is kind of died down again. Like the boy bands wear it people think it's cheesy. Now it's all reality. Tv shows that kind of stuff. But that's that is my childhood right. There is, you know full house and these kinds of shows step by step where there's a moral at the end of the story, and so everyone there's always kind of like the the protagonist is always like, maybe he's unsure, but by the end they know the right thing to do and they play like the violin kind of sad, not quite sad but like heartwarming music. You know like well, and then they give a speech and as a kid you know you don't really like think about it, but that gets into your like I move man deep, because a full house, if you lie I've, learned this as deep in my subconscious. If you lie and then you keep lying, it's snowballs and it gets worse and worse and worse. So it's best to just right away. Tell the truth. That was a really common theme and most sitcoms I. Think that like they're, just trying to teach kids don't lie it's bad you're right, you're, right, sitcoms are youjin by the way. Sitcoms is, is a portmanteau portmanteau, meaning two words put together of situation and comedy so situation and comedy equals sitcom. In this case, okay, nice, nice, I'm gonna, go to my next one. Let's see I think probably every little girl in the 90s in America anyway knew what this was I. Don't know. If you knew it's, this brand called Lisa Frank um Lisa Frank. Are you aware of Lisa Frank? Are you aware at Lisa Frank? No, okay, she knows she knows and Lisa Frank is hey. So Lisa Frank is just bright. It was always like brightly colored school supplies like pinks and purples and blues, and it would always have unicorns and dolphins and mystical creatures. He was just bright and everybody all the girls loved it I loved it. I had Lisa Frank, just whatever I could get my hands on it's B, pencils or erasers, or just pinks and rainbows, and hearts and stuff like that. So I think every every girl who grew up in the 90s knows what Lisa Frank is. Okay, so talking about style in what nots, grunge grunge is something that I hits close to home. For me and I think that came out of the 90s is I mean everybody knows around the world. I think most people know Nirvana yeah Kurt Cobain, and this is something that I guess was brought to the world from Seattle and it was a music genre and it was kind of it's like rock, but sometimes slower, almost emo kind of like sad, usually undertones, but anyways. The style that came with it was the opposite of like the 80s and early 90s of really bright colors. You know it was the opposite. You just wear holey jeans. You don't really shower that much. You don't shave and like plaid and just really like dreary colors. So that was really popular I at least I. Remember in like the early 90s yeah and it's as soon as I saw that card grunge as I got Nirvana. That was that's the first thing that comes to mind when I hear about when I hear grunge I didn't get into the grunge scene. That I was I was busy with boy bands but like grunge for me was never really I was aware. I was aware of Nirvana, but I did not. I was not up the Nirvana mod okay, I'm gonna, go to a style point then too, because you've read up a style point: I'll put up bring up, maybe a female style point scrunchies still popular, perhaps among some people. What is a scrunchie, a scrunchie? Let's see, I, don't have so there's regular rubber bands that you can use to tie back long hair he's making a no shirt with his hand. Yes, it's a very descriptive, very descriptive, I'm the prop, and then you go like this to get digga digga digga there there's like that. If there's an awesome video team somewhere in the world somewhere, that can put like a scrunchie like right here anyway, yeah scrunchie, it's just it's just a piece of elastic with some kind of colorful cloth, wrapped around it and it, but when not in use, he would go and it would scrunch I think I think this is why we call it a scrunchie. But then, when you pull that you could expand it a bit and wrap your hair up in it and then, when you were finished, doing that it would kind of close around it. I had a couple Nintendo anything any game, related stuff, I, remember, game boy is anything handheld, except when I was a kid it. It wasn't like this fancy 3d high, you know highly like vibrant colors. It was like black and white and like you'd, play it in the car and you had to squint and it hurts your head. You know if you're playing too much you're getting like carsick and you're like you, can barely see Mario. That's my game. Boy game boy are any like. There was handheld -. There was like Atari and stuff like that and like Sega Sega was pretty good. That would light up. I was thinking about NES. When you said Nintendo I imagined my NES, the one that like when it wasn't working correctly. You could just pull the cassette on decks. Put it back in so you put the cartridge in here right and sometimes if it was really stubborn and it didn't work, you would blow into this part and you tried it really doesn't make a difference, but you would take churns like me, and my brothers would be like. No, you want to be the one to get it to work, so you take turns hitting I, don't know. Let me let me let me and just by luck you would work. You're like see, see ya know this is super nostalgic, I love, Nintendo I have a game. Two pogs. Do you have pod? Ok, pogs are either simultaneously the most brilliant game in the stupidest game ever invented they're, just discs of cardboard about this size and on one side there's a picture and on the other side there's just nothing, and then you had a thing called a slammer which was essentially just a heavy POG that she would use, and you had to flip. You had to use the slammer to flip the plain cardboard ones. What I don't even know it was that stupid and forgettable of a game, but it was like crazy when I was about I, don't know like 2nd or 3rd grade or something everybody had pogs like we had pogcham days at my school I. Remember that Jesus Lee America we're really obese. Let's go into the gym and sit there and smash easily fogs and like I was telling I was telling her before we started this like one day like my mom wanted me to get a haircut and I was just being stubborn and I wasn't having it. I was in the malls like I want to get a haircut she's like I'll, buy you pogs, and she did. It was like this giant tube of pogs and I was just so thrilled and I agreed to get my haircut well. That was a lot of things that was that were exciting and or popular and or we were into in the 90s. What were you into in the 90s? What was popular in your country? I really have no idea what was popular around the world at that time. Maybe some of these things are similar, please let us know in the comments I'm very interested to find out. We read these by the way, any thoughts any other, any closing thoughts about the 90s you're, not gonna, sing a song for us, no man. Well, that's copyright. We can't do that just like blur that all out of it, no, that was that, was very accurate, so I'm sure we can use that very accurate I mean totally wrong. Clearly we're very good at talking about the 90s okay, but we hope that you are too. We hope that you learn something exciting about the 90s. That's all for us today, thanks very much for watching, and we will see you again soon. Bye, hi everybody. My name is Alisha and I am joined again in the studio by Michael, hello and today we're going to be talking about English conversation strategies. So let's get right into it. Let's start with Michael. What is your first strategy for keeping an english conversation going? This is very important, don't say, I'm, fine, thank you and you you hear this all the time from second language, English, learners or non-native speakers. You learn this. It's one of the first things you learn in an English class. It's easy! It's good! It's a basic its foundation. Okay, that's fine, but as soon as you can switch it up because to me when I meet a foreigner and they come up and if they say hey, how are you say? Oh I'm, fine, you know I'm good whatever, how about you and they say I'm, fine, thank you and you and it's just it's almost robotic, because I've said it so many times and when I hear that I think their English isn't that good and inside I'm, just gonna, be really polite and say hello and talk slowly and try to get out of there as quick as I can so really impress the foreigner, in my opinion, I think the best way to do it is say something you know you use a big word or just like a slang word something like that. When I hear that I go wow, man I want to know what this person thinks. I want to get their point of view and I'm really excited, and then I've had great conversations because of that um yeah. That's a really really good. One actually I think on this YouTube channel actually from a couple years ago. There's a video all about better answers to the question. How are you then I'm? Fine, thank you and you or if someone says hey, how are you oh I'm, good? You are fine, you never I'm, fine! Thank you and you never try to actually use you know, afraid sort of native speaker would use and then that's a clue to the native speaker that, oh maybe this person is ready for a conversation beyond you know basic English. So that's a really good point. I, like that I didn't think of things not to do I only thought of things to do so: okay, cool um- let's see, let's go to my first one, oh, so this strategy in general is just ask the other person a question, I think and I'm guilty of this too. When I'm learning another language, I tend to only get input like somebody else is always asking me the questions and then I forget myself to ask the other person a question. So one question that I like to ask, or you know, a variation. Any kind of WH question is good. Like a food question, what where something like this? If you've been paying attention, you can use any way to transition. In your conversation, this was in a previous video. You can ask something like anyway up to anything fun. This weekend this is a pretty casual conversational question than she can ask just about anybody, whether you've just met them or whether you've known them for a while, but just just get in the habit of asking other people. The question don't wait for someone else to ask you the question so that that's one strategy that I try to use to keep things going. Yeah me too I, agree and I'm gonna, say samesies, because actually, two of my questions for exactly what you said, agree 100%. This is kind of cheating. These should be one, but so always ask questions. So you know again, you forget it's really easy. I'm really guilty of this English non English, whatever I'm guilty of this, and the other thing is ask deep, open-ended questions. So if you ask a yes-or-no question so again, like Alicia was saying it just dead ends, you can't just say you know: do you like cheese, yes or no right? So you want to say what do you think about cheese? What is your favorite kind and kind of open it up to something else? And let it let it just kind of snowball? Yeah I think I think that's that's really a key like I. Have another variation I wish I guess I'll just continue on to cuz. It kind of relates to what you're talking about. Like he's, saying always ask questions, always ask deep open-ended questions. So, like you meant, you just said, don't ask a yes-or-no question because yes or no ends with the yes or the no, so one of the things that I'll do is use a pattern similar to this. Like hey, did you see or hey? Did you hear about blah blah blah? So you can use this little blah blah blah. As your you can ask about the news you can ask about something funny you saw on the Internet you can ask about. You know some something that you heard from another friend of yours, whatever it's just a way to check in with the other person and say: oh did you also experience this thing that I experienced? Let's talk about that, so that might be another question that you can use with people I like that one I really like that one, because you got to stay within people's comfort zone. So maybe you asked- and maybe they don't want to write so a good thing is: did you hear about it? That's up to them. Maybe they don't want to talk about it. They can say. Oh yeah I heard about that, and you can kind of feel the the atmosphere and and realize maybe I shouldn't talk about this change the subject or they get passionate and they start talking about it and there you go and just let it go yeah absolutely one thing again: I'm guilty of is: is you do got to keep keep returning it right, don't let it don't just say, oh yeah, and what I think about that uh bring it back. Ask them. What about you? That's a common thing. I forget about yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, um good I have one more this one um use when you see Fitz, don't I, guess just okay I'll just introduce it compliment the other person or compliment the other person's. This can be a nice strategy just to show that you're enjoying the other person's company. It can be as simple as oh I like your shirt today or oh that's. A nice dress, you're wearing today or oh. Did you get a new haircut that looks good on you, something like that. So this is a nice a nice way to make the other person. Maybe you want to spend more time with you, I think yeah I agree, 100%, two things, one I think it's a good conversation starter. Sometimes, if you've got to be careful with the stranger it can be creepy, it can be a little uncomfortable what you're complimenting right, but if it's something like if they have a t-shirt and it's a band that you both like that's a great conversation starter and you feel wow we're connected. You know number two. The second thing I was thinking about. Is that keep it honest, I, love, I, love a sincere compliment. It really means a lot more and it really does butter them up kind of get them open to having more conversations deeper. That kind of thing one of the things people do which which I don't like is let's say they say, hey nice shirt and then the person out of habit will say. Oh you, too I, like your shirt too, just my opinion. I, don't think this feels really natural doesn't really feel sincere, so I would I would save it. Make a mental note and go hmm I need to return. The favor I need to give them a compliment, but wait until you notice something you really do like and say: hey actually, I love, blah blah blah yeah I. Think that's a great point like when you you can sense whether someone is being sincere or not. What is your next for energy, for continuing an English conversation? Well, don't be afraid to open up I like this one I think this is good. A lot of people will be kind of shy. They won't open up too much again within within your comfort zone, but I like this one, because people will return the favor, because, if you're, just having small talk- and you say you know- the weather is nice today- blah blah blah. You can only go so far, so don't be afraid to say something personal again, your judgment, there'll be a creeper, don't go. We don't want to hear certain things about your life. Don't don't be a creep, don't be a creep, don't be weird, don't be strange and like what you're saying about opening up open up is just a phrase that means share something about yourself, so it can be as simple as what you did last weekend or what you're going to do this weekend or a project that you have coming up. It doesn't mean that you have to spill all of your life secrets to the other person, but just showing that you're willing to share something more personal about yourself can help ingratiate yourself or can help. You know make the other person help. The other person understand you a little bit better. That's a good tip. I like that tip, that's hard to do, though it's hard, it's a little bit scary, I, think to share parts of yourself, but it's good. It's good way to meet people and make friends all right. I. Think that's all! Is that all that you have yeah? That's all I got okay, all right. Well, those are some interesting strategies to keep an english conversation going so give them a try if you're ever at a loss for words and don't know what to say, you can try one of these strategies and hopefully it will help you out. Please let us know if you have any other strategies or anything else that you would like to use or you try to use when you are having trouble, keeping a conversation going, leave us a comment, and let us know what it is. We will see you again next time. Do you have anything else, you'd like to add that's about it all right, so thanks very much for joining us and take it bye. Bye want to speed up your language.
